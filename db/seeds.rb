# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# user1 = User.create(username: "test1")
# user2 = User.create(username: "test2")
# user3 = User.create(username: "test3")

# dog1 = Dog.create(name: "Henry", breed: "German Pointer", about_me: "I'm very nervous and I don't like storms", user_id: 7, profile_pic: "https://i.imgur.com/x8EjAll.jpeg" )
